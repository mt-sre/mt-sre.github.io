## Sprint Retro

Every 3 weeks. 30-minute (max). Before the sprint ends. Right now this happens right before the planning meeting for the next sprint:

* The goals of continuous Retro meetings are:
  * to inspect the current way of working
  * and adapt it if necessary
  * in small steps and an iterative fashion
  * incorporate eventual process changes in the next sprint
* [Guide that @jgwosdz used for our first retro](https://www.notion.so/First-Retro-8cb1180cda1f4b03879065e225392b50)
