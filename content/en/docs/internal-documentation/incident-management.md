An incident refers to an event that can happen at any given time and may cause a decrease in the quality or complete outage of one or more of our services. Internal or external customers, our monitoring and alerting systems, or a member of the SRE team can raise an incident. 

Preparedness for major incidents is crucial. We have established the following Incident Management processes to ensure SREs can follow predetermined procedures: 

- [Incident Management Process](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/service-delivery/service_delivery_wiki/incident_management_process)

- [Incident Response Cheatsheet](https://github.com/openshift/ops-sop/blob/master/policies/incident_response.asciidoc)

- [Automated Incident Management Process (WebRCA)](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/service-delivery/service_delivery_wiki/automated_incident_management_process)


## Coverage
Layered Products SRE (LPSRE) provides 24x7 coverage and support
with primary and secondary on-call SREs responsible for handling production-related issues.

If you need to escalate an incident, please refer to the
 [Layered Products SRE Escalation Procedure](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/sre/wiki/cs_sre_escalation_procedure).
